        "Agencies\nMany major Japanese companies, including Toyota Motor Corp, on Wednesday fully met the wage hike demands of their labor unions, which have been calling for substantial raises to address surging prices amid chronic labor shortages.\nThe government has been paying attention to the annual wage negotiations between management and labor unions to see if the strong push for salary gains will be sustained and extend to small and medium-sized companies, which employ around 70 percent of the country's workforce.\nSeen as a trendsetter in wage negotiations, Toyota, the world's largest carmaker by volume, fully met its union's request on a total resource basis. The firm's union demanded wage hikes of up to 24,450 yen per month, depending on the worker.\nWage hikes remained subdued in Japan for decades following the burst of the asset-inflated bubble economy in the early 1990s and ensuing deflation.\nBut due in part to inflation caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the 'shunto' spring wage talks in 2023 saw the highest pay increase in 30 years.\nNevertheless, the pace of pay growth has yet to keep up with persistent inflation, with real wages falling year-on-year for the third consecutive year in 2024.\nMarket players are also closely monitoring the wage talks, with expectations of robust rises fueling growing speculation that the Bank of Japan will further raise interest rates.\nAmong electronics makers, Hitachi Ltd and NEC Corp each proposed a monthly base wage increase of 17,000 yen, as sought by their unions.\nMajor heavy machinery manufacturers Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd and IHI Corp followed suit in matching their unions' demands.",

      content:
        "CSG Systems International, a company that provides business support solutions with a market capitalization of $1.67 billion and gross profit margins of 48.7%, negotiated a new $600 million credit agreement. The new five-year revolving loan facility, which replaces the company's previous credit arrangement, was established with Royal Bank of Canada as the administrative agent, alongside other financial institutions.\nThe new credit arrangement, effective March 14, 2025, offers CSG Systems increased financial flexibility with a consolidated revolving loan facility, maintaining borrowing rates consistent with the prior agreement. The updated terms also include fewer financial covenants and less restrictive negative covenants compared to the previous credit agreement. This aligns well with the company's prudent financial management, as analysis shows the company operates with a moderate debt level, maintaining a healthy total debt-to-capital ratio of 0.25 and a current ratio of 1.46.\nUpon execution of the new credit agreement, CSG Systems drew $140.6 million from the facility to repay the outstanding balance of the previous credit agreement and cover related fees and expenses. The remaining funds will be allocated for general corporate purposes.\nInterest rates under the new agreement are tied to an adjusted secured overnight financing rate plus a margin ranging from 1.375% to 2.125%, or an alternate base rate plus a margin of 0.375% to 1.125%, based on CSG's leverage ratio. Additionally, the company will incur a commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility.\nIn other recent news, CSG Systems announced a 7% increase in its quarterly cash dividend and has attracted analyst attention, with Jefferies raising its price target to $75 while maintaining a Buy rating. There are also preliminary reports that NEC Corporation might be considering acquiring CSG Systems.\nFor complete details of the credit agreement, refer to CSG's upcoming quarterly report.",

'We are excited that we can deliver high-speed access to our customers and look forward to additional innovative services as a result of this alliance.'\n'Bringing FWA to our customers is an important milestone since our rebranding to the market,' said Bas Touw, Head of IT Mass Market at Odido. 'I am confident that our collaboration with Netcracker will lead to further such innovations as we continue to disrupt the Dutch telecom landscape.'\n'As the leading mobile operator in the Netherlands, Odido is blazing a trail to 5G monetization, including the investment in FWA,' said Benedetto Spaziani, GM at Netcracker.
